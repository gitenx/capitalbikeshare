# capital bike share

Dataset in this project inspired by Bike Sharing Dataset Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset).

The dataset (data folder):
 - raw folder, contains: capitalbikeshare_data_only.csv (compiled from https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html), holiday_raw.csv (list of holidays, extracted from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule), and weather_monthly_raw.csv (the weather info, extracted from freemeteo.com)
 - dataset_cbs_ts.csv (compiled data from three files in raw folder. you can check the process in compile_data.ipynb
 
In this repo, I only uploaded the data exploration (data-exploration.ipynb).

_fun facts and i guess you don't give a shit: it's should be my final project for data science program, but at the last minute i change the dataset (you can check in this github too)._

Anyway, enjoy!
